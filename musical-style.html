<h1>Musical Style</h1>
<p>Grunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Allmusic calls grunge a "hybrid of heavy metal and punk." Alex DiBlasi states that indie rock was a third key source, with the most important influence coming from Sonic Youth's free-form noise. Grunge shares with punk a raw lo fi sound and similar lyrical concerns. It also uses punk's "haphazard" and "untrained" approach to playing and performing. However, grunge was deeper and darker than punk. It slowed down punk's rapid adrenaline"-fueled tempos to a slow, sludgy pace, used more dissonant harmonies, and explored more complex instrumentation reminiscent of the approach used in heavy metal.</p>
<p>Grunge music has what has been called an "ugly" aesthetic, both in the roar of the distorted electric guitars and in the darker lyrical topics. This approach was chosen both to counter the slick, elegant sound of mainstream rock of the time and because grunge artists wanted to reflect the ugliness of the world and shine a light on hidden depths and depravity of the real world in their music.</p>
<p>Some key individuals in the development of the grunge sound, including Sub Pop producer Jack Endino and the Melvins, explained grunge's incorporation of heavy rock influences such as Kiss as musical provocation. Grunge artists considered these bands cheesy but nonetheless enjoyed them. Buzz Osborne of the Melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do and get away with. In the early 1990s, Nirvana's signature stop-start song format became a genre convention.</p>
